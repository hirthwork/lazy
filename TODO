List of features to implement and bugs to fix
=============================================

Legend:
-------
  (*) Features that obviously should be implemented.

  (?) Features that probably isn't required.

  (+) Already implemented features.

  (-) Features, that won't be implemented for some reason.

To do list grouping must be same as listed above.

To do list:
-----------
  (*) Implement thread-safety policies.

  (*) Implement separate storage for move assignable trivial default
    constructable objects and for non-trivial constructable ones.

  (*) Implement copy-on-write policy, which will allow to get rid of
    "mutable" and let copied lazy values to be calculated only once.

  (?) Implement policy for non-steady calculators, which will recalculate
    Value_ on each assignment or copy.

  (?) Implement "void" values support.
