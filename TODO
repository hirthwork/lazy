List of features to implement and bugs to fix
=============================================

Legend:
-------
  (*) Features that obviously should be implemented.

  (?) Features that probably isn't required.

  (+) Already implemented features.

  (-) Features, that won't be implemented for some reason.

To do list grouping must be same as listed above.

To do list:
-----------
  (*) Allow heterogeneous assignments and copying.

  (*) Cover reference returning functions with tests.

  (*) Implement thread-safety policies.

  (*) Implement copy-on-write policy, which will allow to get rid of
    "mutable" and let copied lazy values to be calculated only once.

  (?) Implement policy for non-steady calculators, which will recalculate
    Value_ on each assignment or copy.

  (?) Implement "void" values support.

  (?) Add noexcept to functions.

  (+) Replace all references passed to functions with type trait to have small
    POD types copied, not referenced.

  (+) Implement separate storage for move assignable trivial default
    constructable objects and for non-trivial constructable ones.

  (+) Add static check with minimal value type requirements.

  (+) Assign value types basing on move and copy c'tor and assignment
    presence.
